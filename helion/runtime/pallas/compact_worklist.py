"""JAX builder for Pallas compact-worklist flattening.

Pure JAX and unit-testable on CPU, with no dependency on the Helion compiler.

The generated, per-kernel ``_build_worklist(offsets...)`` (emitted by the
compiler, see ``helion/_compiler/pallas/compact_worklist.py``) computes the
per-owner ``base``/``length`` (and optional dependent ``dep_base``/``dep_len``)
arrays as ``jnp`` expressions, then calls :func:`flatten_worklist` here to turn
the ragged owner x tile product into a flat, padded worklist.  Everything runs
inside the launcher's internal ``jax.jit`` with **nothing ``.item()``-ed**, so
there is no device->host sync and no per-shape recompile: ``num_work`` is a
traced ``jax.Array`` fed straight into ``grid=(num_work,)``; ``UPPER`` is the
only (static, shape-derived) Python int.

The padding scheme mirrors tokamax's ``gmm`` (``jnp.repeat(...,
total_repeat_length=UPPER)`` + ``num_work = cnt.sum()`` fed to ``grid=``): the
metadata arrays have the static shape ``UPPER`` so every BlockSpec ``index_map``
is in-bounds by construction, while only the first ``num_work`` grid points run,
so the padded ``[num_work, UPPER)`` tail never executes.
