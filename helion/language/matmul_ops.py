    Performs a matrix multiplication of tensors with support for multiple dtypes.

    This operation performs matrix multiplication with inputs of various dtypes including
    float16, bfloat16, float32, int8, and FP8 formats (e4m3fn, e5m2). The computation is
    performed with appropriate precision based on the input dtypes.

    Args:
        mat1: First matrix (2D or 3D tensor of torch.float16, torch.bfloat16, torch.float32, torch.int8, torch.float8_e4m3fn, or torch.float8_e5m2)
        mat2: Second matrix (2D or 3D tensor of torch.float16, torch.bfloat16, torch.float32, torch.int8, torch.float8_e4m3fn, or torch.float8_e5m2)
        acc: The accumulator tensor (2D or 3D tensor of torch.float16, torch.float32, or torch.int32).
             If not None, the result is added to this tensor.
             If None, a new tensor is created with appropriate dtype based on inputs.
        out_dtype: Optional dtype that controls the output type of the multiplication prior
            to any accumulation. This maps directly to the Triton ``tl.dot`` ``out_dtype``
            argument and overrides the default promotion rules when provided.

    Returns:
        Result of matrix multiplication. If acc is provided, returns acc + (mat1 @ mat2).
        Otherwise returns (mat1 @ mat2) with promoted dtype.

    Example:
        >>> # FP8 example
        >>> a = torch.randn(32, 64, device="cuda").to(torch.float8_e4m3fn)
        >>> b = torch.randn(64, 128, device="cuda").to(torch.float8_e4m3fn)
        >>> c = torch.zeros(32, 128, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float32)
        >>> result = hl.dot(a, b, acc=c)  # result is c + (a @ b)

        >>> # Float16 example
        >>> a = torch.randn(32, 64, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
        >>> b = torch.randn(64, 128, device="cuda", dtype=torch.float16)
        >>> result = hl.dot(a, b)  # result dtype will be torch.float16

        >>> # Int8 example
        >>> a = torch.randint(-128, 127, (32, 64), device="cuda", dtype=torch.int8)
        >>> b = torch.randint(-128, 127, (64, 128), device="cuda", dtype=torch.int8)
        >>> acc = torch.zeros(32, 128, device="cuda", dtype=torch.int32)
