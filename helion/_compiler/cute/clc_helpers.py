"""CLC (clusterlaunchcontrol) helper for the tcgen05 CLC-persistent path.

G2-H (cute_plan.md): wrap ``nvvm.clusterlaunchcontrol_try_cancel``
in a ``@dsl_user_op`` so the generated kernel can issue the CLC query
from the dedicated scheduler warp. The wrapper mirrors Quack's
``issue_clc_query_nomulticast`` in ``quack/quack/utils.py``; the only
difference is the import path for the helper symbol so Helion-generated
code does not depend on ``quack`` being installed.

The instruction itself requests atomically cancelling the launch of a
cluster that has not started running yet. It asynchronously writes an
opaque response to shared memory indicating success or failure; on
success the response contains the ctaid of the first CTA of the
cancelled cluster, which the scheduler-warp body unpacks via
``cute.arch.clc_response`` to drive the next persistent-loop
iteration.

    """Issue ``nvvm.clusterlaunchcontrol_try_cancel`` (no multicast).

    Helion's CLC scheduler-warp body uses the leader-CTA-only Quack
    pattern for cluster_m>1: only the cluster leader CTA's scheduler
    warp issues the query and then broadcasts the result to peer
    CTAs via ``_cute_store_shared_remote_x4``. A single CLC query
    per cluster keeps the cancellation atomicity scoped correctly,
    so the nomulticast variant is the right choice; a hypothetical
    multicast variant would land here when an alternative topology
    needs cluster-wide query delivery without the SMEM broadcast.
