# ``cute_mma.py`` ``_emit_mma_pipeline`` consumer branch; the
# autotune gate (``consumer_regs_autotune_fragments`` in

# ``_aux_tma_edge_search_enabled`` family (mirroring the aux_stages
# gate) so other paths stay byte-identical at the 256 default. (Cycle
# 46 widened ``_aux_tma_search_enabled`` to also admit the full-tile
# cluster_m=2 family, but this register-cap knob stays scoped to the
# edge gate because its choices were measured only on the T8/CLC edge
# rows.) The choices include 256 so the default-with-knob configuration
