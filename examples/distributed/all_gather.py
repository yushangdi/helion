"""Ring all-gather written in Helion, lowered to a Pallas TPU kernel.

Mirrors the JAX docs example
(``https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/pallas/tpu/distributed.html#example-all-gather-lax-all-gather``)
using two new pieces::

    hl.start_async_remote_copy(tensor, index, device_id)
        # pushes tensor[index] locally -> tensor[index] on peer device_id
    @helion.kernel(distributed=[world_size])
        # marker that this kernel participates in a distributed group

``device_id`` is a flat integer PE id (LOGICAL / NVSHMEM-style
addressing) — obtained on the host side from ``dist.get_rank()`` and
passed to the kernel as an ``hl.constexpr``.  Because the ring math is
Python-level (rank and world_size are compile-time constants per
process), each rank compiles its own specialized kernel.

Algorithm (identical to the JAX docs example):

    Each rank seeds slot ``rank`` of a symmetric gather buffer of shape
    ``(world_size, per_device, inner)``.  At step ``s`` of a
    ``world_size - 1``-step loop, each rank forwards slot
    ``(rank - s) mod world_size`` to its right neighbour.  After
    ``world_size - 1`` steps every rank has the complete gathered
    output in every slot.

Run on a TPU host with 8 chips::

    ``gather`` has shape ``(world_size, *local.shape)`` and is pre-seeded on the
    HOST so slot ``rank`` holds this chip's local piece.  On each of the
    ``world_size - 1`` steps the kernel pushes the current slot to the right
    neighbour; after the loop every rank holds the full gathered tensor.

    The kernel body performs ONLY DMA forwards -- no local store to ``gather`` --
    so ``gather`` is routed to an HBM ref that persists across the grid steps.
    (A local store would force it to VMEM, where each grid program gets a private
    copy and only the seed slot survives; see
    ``helion/_compiler/pallas/plan_tiling.py``.)
