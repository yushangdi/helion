"""Fused Mixture-of-Experts (expert-parallel) with in-kernel reduce-scatter.

DRAFT / SKETCH.  This file is a design + best-attempt implementation of a
Helion kernel that mirrors the Meta "fuse-all MoE" TPU kernel
(``msl-tpu-kernel``'s ``gmm_v2_fused_rs``): gather routed tokens -> GMM1 (gate
+ up) + gated activation -> GMM2 (down) -> weighted **reduce-scatter** of the
expert outputs back to the chip that owns each token, all in one launch.

What RUNS today (VERIFIED on an 8-chip TPU host -- all ranks match reference):
  * ``fused_moe`` -- the end-to-end expert-parallel path: the Helion/Pallas
    compute kernel (``fused_moe_local_kernel``: gather + GMM1 + gated act +
    GMM2) on each chip, then a torch ``reduce_scatter`` across chips.  All 8
    ranks' output shards match ``fused_moe_reference`` (rtol/atol=2e-2).  Run
    with ``--distributed``.
  * ``fused_moe_reference`` -- pure-PyTorch oracle (also verified on CPU).
  NOTE: the cross-chip ``reduce_scatter`` here is a torch PLACEHOLDER standing
  in for the in-kernel ICI direct-write; folding it into the kernel is exactly
  what needs Features 1-4 below.

What is a SKETCH (blocked on remaining Helion features -- see DESIGN NOTES):
  * ``fused_moe_kernel`` -- the *fully fused* distributed kernel that fires the
    ICI reduce-scatter (direct-write) from inside the loop (no torch
    ``reduce_scatter``).  The *asymmetric, per-row data-dependent* remote copy it
    needs is now EXPRESSIBLE via the landed primitive (Features 1-2, below)::

        hl.start_async_remote_copy(
            src, [i], device_id, dst=out_buf, dst_index=[write_pos]
        )

    and is validated in isolation (small-scale cross-chip reduce-scatter matches
    a torch oracle; see the ``test_remote_copy`` codegen tests).  What still
    blocks the *single-launch* fusion here is: (Feature 4) a counting-semaphore
    bulk drain so the tile's per-row pushes don't serialise the ICI lane;
    the two-phase compute->scatter structure inside one Pallas launch (Pallas
    flattens the grid to one pid, so there is no ``hl.barrier`` to separate the
    phases); and, empirically, a Mosaic core-halt when the direct-write runs at
    MoE row width (H=128) that does not reproduce at the small widths the
    isolated test uses.  Until those land, callers use ``fused_moe`` below, which
    runs the Helion compute kernel and does the scatter in torch.

Feature status (details in DESIGN NOTES):
  Features 1-2 (asymmetric + per-row data-dependent remote copy) -- LANDED as
  ``hl.start_async_remote_copy(src, src_index, device_id, dst, dst_index)``.
  Features 3-4 (symmetric-buffer alloc, counting-semaphore bulk drain) -- open.
  Feature 6 (accumulator feature-dim slice for the gated activation -> worked
  around with separate gate/up weights), 7 (in-kernel intermediate as a K-tiled
  matmul operand -> worked around with a full-I GMM2 matmul) -- open.

Run (single-host, 8 TPU chips)::

    source dunfanlu_notes/scripts/init_helion_pallas_tpu.sh
    python examples/distributed/fused_moe.py            # reference + local-kernel checks
    python examples/distributed/fused_moe.py --distributed   # attempt full fused path

DESIGN NOTES: Helion language additions for a fused-MoE reduce-scatter kernel
===========================================================================
Methodology follows "Helion TPU Distributed Support" (Dunfan Lu): every
proposed primitive is designed to lower to BOTH targets --
  * TPU  : ``pltpu.make_async_remote_copy(src_ref, dst_ref, send_sem, recv_sem,
           device_id, device_id_type)`` (push-based, async, PGAS-like).
  * GPU  : ``nvshmem.putmem_signal_block(dst, src, nbytes, signal, sig_val,
           sig_op, pe)`` + ``signal_wait_until`` (push-based, async, PGAS).
Both are push-only, async, and address peers by a flat LOGICAL PE id, so a
single Helion API can target both.  The v1 distributed API already shipped
(``hl.start_async_remote_copy`` + ``@helion.kernel(distributed=[world_size])``,
see ``all_gather.py``).  The fused MoE needed four things beyond it; Features
1-2 have since LANDED, Features 3-4 remain:

--- Feature 1: ASYMMETRIC per-row remote copy (src != dst) -- LANDED -----------
Need.  The reduce-scatter writes one GMM2 output row from a LOCAL staging slot
into an ARBITRARY slot of the owner chip's output buffer:
    out_buf[write_pos]@dest_chip  <-  local_row_out       (write_pos != src idx)
The original ``start_async_remote_copy(tensor, index, device_id)`` only supported
SAME-tensor, SAME-index pushes (``tensor[index]->tensor[index]``) -- enough for
ring all-gather, not for scatter.
Landed as.  The op now takes optional ``dst`` / ``dst_index``::
    hl.start_async_remote_copy(src, src_index, device_id, dst, dst_index)
  pushing ``src[src_index] -> dst[dst_index]`` on the peer; the 3-arg symmetric
  form is preserved as sugar (``dst is src``, ``dst_index is src_index``).
Lowering.
  * Pallas : ``make_async_remote_copy(src.at[..], dst.at[..], ...)`` -- two
             independent refs; a 1:1 fit.
  * NVSHMEM: ``putmem_signal_block(dst_ptr, src_ptr, nbytes, ...)`` -- dst and
             src independent; a 1:1 fit.

--- Feature 2: DATA-DEPENDENT, per-row device_id and dst index -- LANDED -------
Need.  ``dest_chip = token_id // chunk`` and ``write_pos = local_row*top_k +
slot`` are computed PER ROW from ``output_indices`` (runtime scalars), inside
the tile loop.  ``all_gather.py`` only uses a compile-time-ish neighbour id.
Landed as.  ``device_id``, ``src_index`` and ``dst_index`` may all be runtime
device scalars; the codegen emits the copy inside the loop with the scalar as an
SSA value (Pallas ``device_id`` / NVSHMEM ``pe`` both already take a runtime peer
id and a runtime offset -- no backend capability gap).

--- Feature 3: SYMMETRIC output-buffer allocation (hl.symmetric_empty) --------
Need.  The direct-write TARGET must be a symmetric buffer that peers can write
into.  Today the host allocates it differently per backend (GPU:
``symm_mem.empty`` + ``rendezvous``; TPU: a plain tensor).  This is the doc's
"Host-side Tensor-Allocation API Unification" stretch goal.
Proposal.  ``buf = hl.symmetric_empty([chunk*top_k, H], dtype=...)`` inside the
kernel body (or a host helper), returning a backend-appropriate symmetric
tensor.
Lowering.  GPU -> ``symm_mem.empty(...) + rendezvous(group)``;
TPU -> a regular device tensor participating in the ``shard_map`` mesh.

--- Feature 4: COUNTING semaphores / bulk drain for many in-flight pushes -----
Need.  A GM tile fires up to ``tile_m`` per-row pushes; we must NOT ``.wait()``
each inline (that serialises the ICI lane).  The production kernel accumulates
send/recv COUNTS and drains once at the end (triple-buffered staging).
Proposal.  Keep semaphore/signal allocation compiler-managed (doc's codegen
detail): a ``start_async_remote_copy`` in a loop registers a COUNTING
semaphore; a ``hl.remote_copy_drain()`` (or scope exit) waits for the running
count.  User never names a semaphore.
Lowering.
  * Pallas : one send_sem/recv_sem pair; drain = a degenerate self-copy ``.wait``
             on the accumulated byte count (exactly what ``gmm_v2_fused_rs``
             does at kernel exit).
  * NVSHMEM: ``putmem_signal_block(..., signal, +1, NVSHMEM_SIGNAL_ADD)`` then
             ``signal_wait_until(sig, GE, expected_count)`` / ``nvshmem_quiet``.

--- Feature 5: NO-REDUCTION unique-slot scatter (a design choice, not a feat) -
The v2 "nodedup" scheme gives every ``(token, top_k-slot)`` a UNIQUE
destination slot, so concurrent remote writes NEVER collide -> a pure write, no
scatter-add, no receive buffer.  This is deliberately backend-portable: it
needs NO GPU atomics (``nvshmem`` atomic-add) and NO TPU read-modify-write.
Helion should document/encourage this pattern; the alternative "dedup"
(accumulate per token) would require atomics on GPU and an HBM accumulator on
TPU -- a heavier lowering we defer.

--- Feature 6: feature-dim slice of a tile-local accumulator (compute-side) ---
Need.  A fused MoE computes GMM1 into one ``[tile_m, 2I]`` accumulator and
splits it ``gate = acc[:, :I]; up = acc[:, I:]`` for the gated activation.
Found empirically: Helion tracing rejects ``acc[:, :I]`` on a device value
(``InternalError: a.node.constant should not be None``) -- a static feature-dim
slice of an in-kernel accumulator is not yet lowered.
Workaround used here.  Pass gate/up as SEPARATE weight tensors and keep two
accumulators (``acc_gate``, ``acc_up``); no accumulator slicing.  The host
wrapper does the ``w1[...,:I]/w1[...,I:]`` split (cheap, one-time).
Proposal.  Support static integer slicing of device tensors along a non-tiled
dim (both backends emit trivial sub-view / select on registers/VMEM).  Backend
neutral -- no Pallas/NVSHMEM capability gap, purely a Helion tracer feature.
--- Feature 7: in-kernel intermediate as a tiled matmul operand (compute-side)-
Need.  Fusing GMM1->act->GMM2 makes the 2nd matmul's LHS an IN-KERNEL value
``inter`` (not a host arg).  Tiling GMM2's K dim needs ``inter[:, tile_k]``,
which Helion rejects (``InvalidIndexingType: got u6``) -- tiled subscription of
a device intermediate isn't lowered.
Workaround used here.  Contract the FULL I in one ``torch.matmul(inter,
w2[e])`` (no K-tiling of the intermediate).  Fine for the example; for large I
this must eventually tile K, so a real fused kernel needs this feature (or a
VMEM-resident "accumulator that can be re-tiled" abstraction).
Proposal.  Allow ``hl.tile`` subscription of in-kernel intermediates (device
values), so a fused multi-matmul kernel can K-tile the 2nd GEMM.  Backend
neutral (both lower to VMEM/register sub-tiles); a Helion tracer/codegen
feature.  This is the crux that makes single-kernel GMM1+act+GMM2 fusion (the
whole point of the v2 kernel) expressible.

--- (Stretch, out of scope) in-kernel all-gather of the inputs ---------------
The landed v2 kernel still relies on an UPSTREAM all-gather so every chip sees
all tokens (Feature: ``_replicate_full``).  Fusing that gather into the kernel
(persistent token cache + neighbour-relay) is the msl-tpu-kernel "future work
5.1"; it would reuse Features 1-4.  Not attempted here.
