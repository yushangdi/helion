# Helion Benchmark Dashboard

Interactive dashboard for visualizing Helion benchmark results across GPU platforms (H100, B200, B200 CuTe, MI325X, MI350X). Tracks kernel latency, speedup against each benchmark's baseline, compile time, and accuracy over time.

Deployed at https://helionlang.com/dashboard/ alongside the main docs. The docs-deploy workflow runs `build_dashboard_data.py` after each docs push or Benchmark Dispatch completion, generating `dashboard-data.json` that `index.html` fetches at runtime.

The **Pretuned** tab is fed by a separate pipeline: the nightly **Benchmark Pretuned Dispatch** workflow runs every kernel under `pretuned_kernels/` (via `pretuned_kernels/run.py`) with its checked-in heuristic and named reference baselines, then uploads aggregate metrics or an error for each kernel. `build_pretuned_dashboard_data.py` aggregates those into `pretuned-dashboard-data.json`, which `index.html` lazily fetches when the Pretuned tab is opened. It tracks the latest CI status plus geomean speedup, win counts, and best speedup per kernel/platform over time; the headline compares with the fastest available baseline and the per-kernel dropdown shows each baseline separately.
